# OpenMRS BuiltIn Reports Open Web App

This repository contains the openmrs-owa-builtinreports OpenMRS Open Web App.
Built-in reports OWA provides basic reporting and give some insight into your data in Reference Application distribution. Data can be seen visually how they have spread and it gives an overview about the present data. Currently there are some basic reports available. 

For further documentation about OpenMRS Open Web Apps see
[the wiki page](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Open+Web+Apps+Module).

## Development

### Production Build

You will need NodeJS 4+ installed to do this. See the install instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

Once you have NodeJS installed, install the dependencies (first time only):

```sh
npm install
```

Build the distributable using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as follows:

````sh
npm run build:prod
````

This will create a file called `openmrs-owa-builtinreports-1.0.0.zip` file in the `dist` directory,
which can be uploaded to the OpenMRS Open Web Apps module.

### Local Deploy

To deploy directly to your local Open Web Apps directory, run:

````
npm run build:deploy
````

This will build and deploy the app to the `/home/user/openmrs/server/owa/`
directory(In linux based distributions). To change the deploy directory, edit the `LOCAL_OWA_FOLDER` entry in
`config.json`. If this file does not exists, create one in the root directory
that looks like:

```js
{
  "LOCAL_OWA_FOLDER": "/home/user/openmrs/server/owa/"
}
```

### Live Reload

To use [Browersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) to watch your files and reload
the page, inject CSS or synchronize user actions across browser instances, you
will need the `APP_ENTRY_POINT` entry in your `config.json` file:

```js
{
  "LOCAL_OWA_FOLDER": "/home/user/openmrs/server/owa/",
  "APP_ENTRY_POINT": "http://localhost:8080/openmrs/owa/openmrs-owa-builtinreports-1.0.0/index.html"
}
```
Run Browsersync as follows:

```
npm run watch
```

### Extending

Install [npm](http://npmjs.com/) packages dependencies as follows:

````sh
npm install --save <package>
````

To use the installed package, import it as follows:

````js
//import and assign to variable
import variableName from 'package';
````

To contain package in vendor bundle, remember to add it to vendor entry point array, eg.:

````js
entry: {
  app : `${__dirname}/app/js/owa.js`,
  css: `${__dirname}/app/css/owa.css`,
  vendor : [
    'package',
    ...//other packages in vendor bundle
  ]
},
````

Any files that you add manually must be added in the `app` directory.

### Troubleshooting

##### [HTTP access control (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)

You may experience problems due to the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header not
being set by OpenMRS. To fix this you'll need to enable Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing in Tomcat.

See instructions [here](http://enable-cors.org/server_tomcat.html) for Tomcat 7 and [here](https://www.dforge.net/2013/09/16/enabling-cors-on-apache-tomcat-6/) for Tomcat 6.
